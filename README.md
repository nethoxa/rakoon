This is a transaction fuzzer for the Ethereum Protocol, with per-transaction custom mutators, an user interface for seeing live data from the fuzzer and a terminal to ineract with it in real time. Huge thanks to [Marius van der Wijden](https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden) for building [tx-fuzz](https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/tx-fuzz), which I used as reference in many parts of this project, as well as to the [alloy team](https://github.com/alloy-rs), as I leveraged heavily on them to build this.

## Usage

It is as simple as doing

```shell
./rakoon
```

and the user interface will pop-up. If there is no binary in the root of the project (it should be if I'm not stupid), then run

```shell
make build
```

and it will be there.

### Commands

The following commands are available in the terminal interface:

#### Set Configuration
- `set global rpc <URL>` - Set the global RPC URL
- `set global sk <private_key>` - Set the global private key
- `set global seed <number>` - Set the global seed
- `set global happy <true/false>` - Set the global happy mode

- `set <runner> rpc <URL>` - Set RPC URL for a specific runner
- `set <runner> sk <private_key>` - Set private key for a specific runner
- `set <runner> seed <number>` - Set seed for a specific runner
- `set <runner> happy <true/false>` - Set happy mode for a specific runner

Where `<runner>` can be one of `al`, `blob`, `eip1559`, `eip7702`, `legacy`, `random`

#### Reset Configuration
- `reset global all` - Reset all global configuration
- `reset global rpc` - Reset global RPC URL
- `reset global sk` - Reset global private key
- `reset global seed` - Reset global seed
- `reset global happy` - Reset global happy mode

- `reset <runner> all` - Reset all configuration for a specific runner
- `reset <runner> rpc` - Reset RPC URL for a specific runner
- `reset <runner> sk` - Reset private key for a specific runner
- `reset <runner> seed` - Reset seed for a specific runner
- `reset <runner> happy` - Reset happy mode for a specific runner

#### Runner Control
- `start` - Start all runners
- `start <runner>` - Start a specific runner
- `stop` - Stop all runners
- `stop <runner>` - Stop a specific runner

#### Other Commands
- `exit` - Exit the application

# TODO

- [ ] More mutators
- [Â ] Implement the calls to the mutator to mutate tx specific stuff
- [ ] Implement happy paths to send valid txs
- [ ] Be able to send wrong type txs like sidecars in legacy txs and so on
- [ ] tx counter not implemented yet
