This is a transaction fuzzer for the Ethereum Protocol, with per-transaction custom mutators, an user interface for seeing live data from the fuzzer and a terminal to ineract with it in real time. Huge thanks to [Marius van der Wijden](https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden) for building [tx-fuzz](https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/tx-fuzz), which I used as reference in many parts of this project.

## Usage

It is as simple as doing

```shell
make run
```

and the user interface will pop-up, showing all the available commands and his flags. For reference, we put them here:
